# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) – Lab Programs

This repository contains C language implementations of the laboratory exercises for the **Algorithms Laboratory (CS39001)** course, following the official lab manual of KIIT University.  
The programs are organized **day-wise** based on the course schedule.

## 📚 Overview
These programs demonstrate:
- Data structures & algorithm basics
- Sorting algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Heap & Priority Queues
- Greedy methods
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph algorithms
- Amortized analysis

### **Day 3** – Divide and Conquer
1. [Insertion sort with loop iteration count for user input](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/DAA/blob/main/Day%203/program1.c)  
2. [Insertion sort with loop iteration count for random integers via srand](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/DAA/blob/main/Day%203/program2.c)  


## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution
All programs are written in standard C and can be compiled with GCC:
```bash
gcc program_name.c -o output_name
./output_name
```
Some programs require file I/O, for example:
```bash
gcc program1.c -o program1
./program1 input.txt output.txt
```
Refer to comments in each file for exact input/output formats.
