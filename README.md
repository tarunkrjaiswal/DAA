## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation & Execution
All programs are written in standard C and can be compiled with GCC:
```bash
gcc program_name.c -o output_name
./output_name
```
Some programs require file I/O, for example:
```bash
gcc program1.c -o program1
./program1 input.txt output.txt
```
Refer to comments in each file for exact input/output formats.
